Main Program
Author: [Brant Anderson]
Description: This file contains the main logic of the stock price prediction program, including data collection, real-time integration, prediction, 
risk management, and model training. The program accepts user input for the stock symbol, making it capable of analyzing any Fortune 500 company.
